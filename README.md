## A little about me:

- 💻 I’m currently working on redesigning some personal projects including my event planning app Event Handler.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js, AWS, and shopify.
- 🎓 I recently graduated from Flatiron School Software Engineering program!
- 🐕 Ask me about my dog Cannoli.
- 🍣 Fun fact: I'm a professionally trained chef and food stylist. I've worked on all your favorite food TV shows.

## A lot about me:
I've secretly been obsessed with coding since 2004.

The internet was still very young and “coding” wasn’t really a thing yet, but I signed up for a class called "Business Computer Programming." We learned Java, some SQL, and Oracle Database management. We made console games and rudimentary animations with a GUI. We learned how to take apart a CPU and put it back together. Every other Friday we either watched tech themed movies like “Tron” and “Pirates of Silicon Valley” or played with programmable Erector Set-looking robots. I loved every minute of it and yet I had no idea what this powerful skill would mean to me further down the road. 

In college I fell in love with the internet and its ever-evolving and pervasive culture. I entered the work force through an extremely online media company and eventually found my way into digital media and television production where I got to pursue many passions and interests including sports, NYC culture, and food and cooking. 

When the pandemic hit, however, I was stuck in my living room trying to do a VERY in-person job remotely and I stumbled upon a website that reignited my latent coding obsession: the website for Recess soda brand designed by a branding and design collective called Day Job. The tiny animated clouds, color gradients, and smooth parallax scrolling made me feel things! I loved the idea of making awesome websites for small food and beverage brands. 

And so... I immersed myself in all things web development. I couldn’t stop thinking about it! When I wasn’t doing my regular job, I was learning JavaScript and CSS at Codecademy and watching YouTube tutorials. After a year of learning on my own, I decided to enroll in the Software Engineering Program at Flatiron School and haven’t looked back!

Front-end web development really plays to my strengths, interests, and experiences: creativity, problem solving, learning new things very quickly, an extreme desire to make everything more efficient, coming up with creative solutions on the fly, and just simply wanting to make things look cool.

My current specialties are JavaScript, Vanilla CSS, HTML, Ruby, React, and jQuery, Bootstrap and Git/GitHub. I also have a close working knowledge of back-end frameworks and languages such as Ruby on Rails, SQL, Active Record and Python. I’m currently exploring Node.js, AWS, and Shopify, and CMS systems and strengthening my CSS and animation skills.

## TL;DR
I like coding and cooking and food + bev marketing.
